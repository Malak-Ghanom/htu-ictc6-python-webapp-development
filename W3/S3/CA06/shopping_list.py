# Shopping List

# Your shopping list should keep asking for new items until nothing is entered (no input followed by enter/return key).
# The program should then print a menu for the user to choose one of the following options:
# (A)dd - To add a new item to the list.
# (F)ind - To search for an item in the list.
# (P)rint - To pretty print the list.
# (S)ort - To sort the list.
# (C)lear - To clear all items in the list.
# (Q)uit - To exit your program.

# TODO: Define a data structure to keep track of your shopping list.

# TODO: Implement a function to show the menu to the user, then wait for a valid user choice.
