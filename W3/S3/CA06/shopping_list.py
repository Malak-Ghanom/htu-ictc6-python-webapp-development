# Shopping List

# Your shopping list should keep asking for new items until nothing is entered (no input followed by enter/return key). 
# The program should then print a menu for the user to choose one of the following options:
# 

# TODO: Define a data structure to keep track of your shopping list


# TODO: Implement a function to add an item to your shopping list
def add_item(item):
    pass

# TODO: Implement a function to find an item in your shopping list
def find_item(item):
    pass
