## Learning Resources

* [Go through the Try Git Guide](https://try.github.io/)
* [Read the Git Handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/)
* [Try this Visual Git Tool](https://git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/)
* [learngitbranching.js](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)

## Creating and Working with Branches

Let’s create a branch called `experiment` where we add **cilantro** to `ingredients.txt`.

```sh
$ git branch experiment    # create branch called "experiment" pointing to the present commit
$ git checkout experiment  # switch to branch "experiment"
$ git branch               # list all local branches and show on which branch we are
```

* Verify that you are on the `experiment` branch.

```sh
$ git branch

* experiment
  master
```

* Then add **2 tbsp cilantro on top** of `ingredients.txt`:

```
* 2 tbsp cilantro
* 2 avocados
* 1 lime
* 2 tsp salt
* 1/2 onion
```

* Stage this and commit it with the message “let us try with some cilantro”.
* Then reduce the amount of cilantro to 1 tbsp, stage and commit again with “maybe little bit less cilantro”.

We have created two new commits:

```sh
$ git log -- oneline

* 6feb49d (HEAD -> experiment) maybe little bit less cilantro
* 7cf6d8c let us try with some cilantro
* dd4472c (master) we should not forget to enjoy
* 2bb9bb4 add half an onion
* 2d79e7e adding ingredients and instructions
```

### Try it Yourself

1. Change to the branch master.
2. Create another branch called `less-salt` where you reduce the amount of salt.
3. Commit your changes to the `less-salt` branch.

## Merging Branches

It turned out that our `experiment` with cilantro was a good idea. Our goal now is to merge `experiment` into `master`.

First we make sure we are on the branch we wish to merge **into**:

```sh
$ git branch

  experiment
  less-salt
* master
```

Then we merge `experiment` **into** `master`:

```sh
$ git merge experiment
```

* How can you verify the result in the terminal?
  * Hint: Use `git branch --merged`.

Observe how Git nicely merged the changed amount of salt and the new ingredient in the same file without us merging it manually:

```sh
$ cat ingredients.txt

* 1 tbsp cilantro
* 2 avocados
* 1 lime
* 1 tsp salt
* 1/2 onion
```

If the same file is changed in both branches, Git attempts to incorporate both changes into the merged file. If the changes overlap then the user has to manually settle merge conflicts (as discussed earlier).

## Deleting Branches

Now that we have merged both of our branches back into **master**, we can delete our branches.

```sh
$ git branch --merged

  experiment
  less-salt
* master

$ git branch -d experiment less-salt
```

## Git Cheatsheet

```sh
$ git branch               # see where we are
$ git branch <name>        # create branch <name>
$ git checkout <name>      # switch to branch <name>
$ git merge <name>         # merge branch <name> (to current branch)
$ git branch -d <name>     # delete branch <name>
$ git branch -D <name>     # delete unmerged branch

# A shorthand form to create and checkout a new branch
$ git checkout -b <name>   # create branch <name> and switch to it
```

## Typical Workflow with Branches

```sh
$ git checkout -b new-feature  # create branch, switch to it
$ git commit                   # work, work, work, ...
                               # test
                               # feature is ready
$ git checkout master          # switch to master
$ git merge new-feature        # merge work to master
$ git branch -d new-feature    # remove branch
```

## Test Your Knowledge

* Which of the following combos (one or more) creates a new branch and makes a commit to it?

1. ```sh
	$ git branch new-branch
	$ git add file.txt
	$ git commit
	```
2. ```sh
	$ git add file.txt
	$ git branch new-branch
	$ git checkout new-branch
	$ git commit
	```
3. ```sh
	$ git checkout -b new-branch
	$ git add file.txt
	$ git commit
	```
4. ```sh
	$ git checkout new-branch
	$ git add file.txt
	$ git commit	
	```

* What is the difference between `git branch -d <name>` and `git branch -D <name>`?

* How do we use the `git checkout` command to create a new branch?

## Conflict Resolution

### Creating a Conflict

* Create two branches from master: one called `like-cilantro`, one called `dislike-cilantro`.

* On the two branches make **different modifications** to the amount of the **same ingredient**.

On the branch `like-cilantro` we have the following change:

```sh
$ git diff master like-cilantro

diff --git a/ingredients.txt b/ingredients.txt
index a83af39..83f2f94 100644
--- a/ingredients.txt
+++ b/ingredients.txt
@@ -1,4 +1,4 @@
-* 1 tbsp cilantro
+* 2 tbsp cilantro
 * 2 avocados
 * 1 lime
 * 1 tsp salt
```

And on the branch `dislike-cilantro` we have the following change:

```sh
$ git diff master dislike-cilantro

diff --git a/ingredients.txt b/ingredients.txt
index a83af39..2f60e23 100644
--- a/ingredients.txt
+++ b/ingredients.txt
@@ -1,4 +1,4 @@
-* 1 tbsp cilantro
+* 0.5 tbsp cilantro
 * 2 avocados
 * 1 lime
 * 1 tsp salt
```

* What do you expect will happen when we try to merge these two branches into master?
  
```sh
$ git checkout master
$ git status
$ git merge like-cilantro

Updating 4b3e3cc..55d1ce2
Fast-forward
 ingredients.txt | 2 +-
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

But the second will fail:

```sh
$ git merge dislike-cilantro

Auto-merging ingredients.txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in ingredients.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

Without conflict Git would have automatically created a merge commit, but since there is a conflict, Git did not commit:

```sh
$ git status

On branch master
You have unmerged paths.
  (fix conflicts and run "git commit")
  (use "git merge --abort" to abort the merge)

Unmerged paths:
  (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)

	both modified:   ingredients.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

Observe how Git gives us clear instructions on how to move forward.

```sh
$ cat ingredients.txt

<<<<<<< HEAD
* 2 tbsp cilantro
=======
* 0.5 tbsp cilantro
>>>>>>> dislike-cilantro
* 2 avocados
* 1 lime
* 1 tsp salt
* 1/2 onion
```

Git inserted resolution markers (the <<<<<<<, >>>>>>>, and =======).

You can also use `git diff` to see the conflict parts.

```sh
$ git diff

diff --cc ingredients.txt
index 83f2f94,2f60e23..0000000
--- a/ingredients.txt
+++ b/ingredients.txt
@@@ -1,4 -1,4 +1,8 @@@
++<<<<<<< HEAD
 +* 2 tbsp cilantro
++=======
+ * 0.5 tbsp cilantro
++>>>>>>> dislike-cilantro
  * 2 avocados
  * 1 lime
  * 1 tsp salt
```

### Resolving a Conflict

When merge conflicts occur, Git is unable to automatically merge our changes.
We have to manually edit our files and resolve the conflicts between the resolution markers.

You only have to resolve what Git was not able to merge. Git stages all files without conflicts and leaves the files with conflicts unstaged.

#### Workflow for Conflict Resolution

* Check status with git status and git diff.
* Decide what you keep (the one, the other, or both or something else). Edit the file to do this.
  * Remove the resolution markers, if not already done.
  * The file(s) should now look exactly how you want them.
* Check status with `git status` and `git diff`.
* Tell Git that you have resolved the conflict with `git add ingredients.txt`.
* Verify the result with `git status`.
* Finally commit the merge with just `git commit` - everything is pre-filled.

### Try it Yourself

1. After you have merged `like-cilantro` and `dislike-cilantro` create again two branches.
2. Again modify some ingredient on both branches.
3. Merge one, merge the other and observe a conflict, resolve the conflict and commit the merge.
4. What happens if you apply the same modification on both branches?

## Working with Remote

To push or pull changes form a remote repository you need to add SSH keys to your Github account.
