## Hello, Flask (World)!

For this class assignment, you will create a minimal Flask application. This class assignment focuses more on your workflow as a web application developer, and the basic project structure rather than the functionality of the project.

### Objectives

1. Create and use virtual environments.
2. Develop your first Flask web application.
3. Run and test your application.

### Workflow

1. Create a new directory for your project.
2. Setup a new virtual environment for your project.
3. Install your project dependencies.
   * Remember to activate your environment before installing your project dependencies.
4. Develop your application (see route details below).
5. Run your application (in `development` mode).
6. Test your application in your browser.

### Your Application

Your application should have 5 routes:

1. **hello_world** - Returns the message "Hello, world!".
2. **hello_flask** - Returns the message "Hello, Flask. I like the simplicity of Flask.".
3. **magic_number** - Returns a random number within a range you choose.
4. **tell_time** - Return the current timestamp in an `h1` element.
5. **some_html** - Returns an HTML `<ul>` element with items from a a Python list.
