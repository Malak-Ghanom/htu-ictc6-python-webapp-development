## Problems

1. Given an input list remove the element at index `2` and add it at index `4` and also at the end of the list.
   * `list = [54, 44, 27, 79, 91, 41]` 
   * `results_list = [54, 44, 79, 27, 91, 41, 27]`
2. Given a list, print the length of the list. Then print out the minimum and maximum values.
   * `list = [87, 45, 41, 65, 94, 41, 99, 94]`
   * `min = 41 max = 99`
3. Given a list slice it into a three equal slices and then print each slice reversed.
4. Given a list, print the list sorted in descending order.
   * `list = [87, 45, 41, 65, 94, 41, 99, 94]`
5. Given a list, count the number of times `Apple` appears in the list. Print the index of the first `Strawberry`.
   * `list = ['Orange', 'Apple', 'Apple', 'Mango', 'Watermelon', 'Apple', 'Strawberry']`
6. Given a list, add the item `7000` after the item `6000` in the list.
   * `list = [10, 20, [300, 400, [5000, 6000], 500], 30, 40]`
